# QF623: Portfolio Management Project 
(Low frequency quant strategies)
 

Objective: In this project, we use stylized long-short equity factor mimicking portfolios 
from Ken French’s data library as building blocks to construct a low-frequency trading 
strategy. 3 distinct modeling approaches will be used and each group will be asked to 
focus on one of these approaches (to be assigned by instructor). The following 
approaches are: 
 
• Risk-based (equal risk contribution, sensitivity to the market and relevant 
marco risk factors) 
• Trend-following (application of moving averages to determine trend) 
• Regime-based (Markov-state models) 
 

Data: Go to the Ken French’s data library to create monthly time series of different 
factors formed on size and different fundamental, risk and price-volume characteristics. 
 

Programming language: Matlab/ R/ Python
